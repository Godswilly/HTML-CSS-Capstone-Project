# Hospital-directory-in-Nigeria

This project is a sample of an online directory of the hospitals in Nigeria. This project based on the prototype made by Mathew Njuguna and others on Behance.

This project is my HTML & CSS Capstone Project in the Microverse program.

This project aimed to apply all the basics HTML & CSS properties I have learned using best practices to conclude my HTML & CSS section of the Microverse software development Program.
